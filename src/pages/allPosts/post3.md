Well, I can’t say that I’m a seasoned wedding crasher, but I have indulged in the sport (successfully) once in my final year of BTech. I went to college in the quaint little city of Bhubaneswar, that offered us the perfect blend of marriage functions that were not too uptight to check the guests for their invites and not too indifferent to whip up a menu that we wouldn't end up licking our fingers after. Anyhow, here goes my step-by-step account of my experience at Wedding Crashing:

1. **Teaming up:** This is not a solo sport, and one needs to round up a little wedding party. I found 4 others from my batch who shared the same level of hunger, shamelessness and machiavellianism as me.

2. **Do your homework:** Figuring out that Dec-Mar is the wedding season in India is not enough! We first pored over our locality’s Google Map and marked the banquets that looked less intimidating in terms of exclusivity. Next, one of us called up the banquet owners and went “Sir! We want to throw a party tonight urgently. Are your grounds available?”. If the reply comes something on the lines of “No, Madam. We’re already booked for a marriage reception.”, eureka, you’ve struck gold!

3. **Play Dress-up:** If you need to rob The Royal Mint of Spain, you wear a Dali Mask. If you need to crash a wedding, you go ga-ga on all your wedding finery. And if you ask me, I’d advise you to add one of those gift-money envelopes to wave in your hands while at the venue.

4. **Decide on a common back-up story:** The first party we crashed went all south when the perenially smiling namaste-ing aunty at the gate decided to ask us whose relation we were. Sweating underneath all our fancy wedding gear, we gave her an all synced up previously concocted account of how our professor, Dr. Sahu (the most common Odia surname) had invited us for his son’s reception at XYZ Halls (where XYZ was replaced by a prominent banquet nearby, courtesy our Google Maps homework). They politely directed us to the aforementioned banquet, and besides some damage to our self-esteem, we came out unscathed.

5. **Be fashionably late:** One of the reasons we got called out at the first party we tried to crash, was because we were too early. When the usual wedding crowd starts piling in, the gate-aunties get bored of trying to place who is who. So, we twiddled our thumbs at a bus-stop for about an hour, before commencing our next heist.

6. **Slither in confidently:** While entering the venue, try to fit in by smiling, nodding and namaste-ing the gate-aunties and gate-uncles. Don’t stop to do any small talk for that might be pushing your luck. Don’t stop for photographs at their fancy installations, and once inside, don’t loiter near the stage-area. Break up into smaller groups to look less conspicuous and focus your mouths on eating rather than spewing out self-incriminatory garbage like “Hurrah, we did it!”.

7. **Attack:** On the food, obviously. Go back for the second helping, or in my case, the third, because while you jolly well didn’t earn it, but that barely matters because you’re a shameless ass and you ate up the remainders of your shame with your first helping anyway.

8. **Operation Retract:** Slither out while there are still enough guests at the venue for cover because you don’t want to know what happens after the family realises they didn’t invite the weirdo in the corner sucking at their last piece of Gulab Jamun.

9. **Hip hip hurray:** Celebrate with the high that is partly caused by all the sugar you gobbled and partly by the victory of your crashing heist.

Overall, it was a fine experience, and while I might forget the tongue-twister names of the unknowingly-generous Odia couple, I wish for them a lifetime of happiness!
